    - Name: genisoimage
      AsWholeName: yes
      Summary: Creates an image of an ISO9660 filesystem
      Group: Applications/System
      Description: |
          The genisoimage program is used as a pre-mastering program; i.e., it
          generates the ISO9660 filesystem. Genisoimage takes a snapshot of
          a given directory tree and generates a binary image of the tree
          which will correspond to an ISO9660 filesystem when written to
          a block device. Genisoimage is used for writing CD-ROMs, and includes
          support for creating bootable El Torito CD-ROMs.
          
          Install the genisoimage package if you need a program for writing
          CD-ROMs.

    - Name: dirsplit
      AsWholeName: yes
      Summary: Splits directory into multiple volumes with equal size
      Group: Applications/System
      Description: |
          The displit utility is designed to for a simple purpose: convert a 
          directory with many multiple files (which are all smaller than a
          certain medium, eg.  DVD) and "splits" it into "volumes", looking 
          for the optimal order to get  the  best  space/medium-
          number efficiency.
      Requires:
          - genisoimage = %{version}-%{release}
